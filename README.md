<h1> Website Building for Personal and Professional Projects: Self-introduction and coding showcase </h1>

<h2> About the Project </h2>

I am creating a website that can complement my resume, goals and vision within a single virtual space
It is aimed for myself as a personal growth project, aimed at potential employers and at people that would like to get to know me.

<h2> Installation </h2>

There are no major system requirements for the project, it is mainly done in JS and HTML. The code will be posted in the project as well so it can serve as
reference and guide for users that would like to create something similar

<h2> Use cases </h2>

The project can be adapated into any type of website desired, it will require customization accordingly, and some of these websites can include the following:
1. Resume Website: Showcase technical code to employers, this will significantly <b>improve the job search sucess rate.</b>
2. Service/Product Website: Present a service or product that can be sold to a direct customer, this will reach out to more people and <b>potentially increase sales.</b>
3. Company website: Establish a company comprehensive site, including vision, mision, values and roadmap. It <b> increases brand awareness and employee engagement.</b>

<h2> Updates and support </h2>

I will keep my website updated with new features as I learn and implement them. Any questions or suggestions can be sent to my email: <b><i>gonz_ge97@hotmail.com</b></i>

<h2> Website Roadmap </h2>

The upcoming updates will consist in adding functionality to the website, getting more complex interactions and animations added to improve the user experience.
